**1. Core Concept**

A live, self-organizing network of local communities. New commuters are dynamically notified of nearby communities based on their real-time location. The platform facilitates peer-to-peer help, with an AI Steward acting as a real-time facilitator to enhance, not replace, human connection.

**2. Technology Architecture**

* **Framework:** **Next.js 15 (App Router)** for dynamic server-side rendering and API routes.
* **Database:** **MySQL** for relational data integrity and scalability.
* **Authentication:** **NextAuth.js** for a modular auth system, utilizing **Supabase** for email/password and **Google** for OAuth.
* **File Storage:** **LocalStack S3 Mock** for development, ensuring a seamless transition to a production S3 bucket.
* **AI Engine:** **Google Gemini AI** for all generative and analytical AI tasks.
* **Payments:** **Dodo Payments API** for managing all premium subscription tiers.

**3. Key Dynamic Functionalities**

* **Geo-Dynamic Community Discovery:** The system continuously suggests communities to users based on their live geographical coordinates.
* **Real-Time Information Feeds:** Community feeds are populated with user-generated content (questions, alerts on roadblocks/protests) fetched on-demand. All data, including member counts and post history, is live from the database.
* **Dynamic Community Management:** Users can request to create new communities. These requests enter a moderation queue for an admin to dynamically approve, making them instantly public. All community metadata (title, description) is managed via an admin dashboard and reflects immediately.
* **AI Steward Facilitation:** The AI dynamically analyzes every new post in real-time to perform triage, smart-routing to relevant users, and automated tagging.

**4. Monetization Model (Fully Integrated)**

The platform's premium features are designed as on-demand, dynamic services.

    * **AI-Powered Planning:** Generate personalized, full-day commute and activity plans based on real-time community knowledge and user inputs.

* **Business Tier:**
    * Businesses can partner with communities dynamically.
    * A **Verified Badge** is applied across the platform in real-time upon subscription.
